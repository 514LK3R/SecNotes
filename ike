# Tunnel Group aka Group Authentication with pre-shared-key

dumb reminder: the password used for Group Authentication happens before the individual auth. User auth happens on the radius server.

# group names or ID enumeration from vulnerable Cisco devices
* by the presence of the Dead Peer Detection
ike-scan -M -A --id=<need to guess valid groupname> 1.2.3.4

First vuln was devices would only return HASH_R when id is correct

Now devices always return a HASH_R wether id is correct or not (to prevent enumeration that used to be possible but older devices would only respond to a correct ID).
However HASH_R can only be cracked if guessed ID is correct

Another group name enumeration vulnerability exists for Cisco devices
The presence of a 'Dead Peer Detectionâ€™ (DPD) payload with an unlikely correct groupname indicates a patched ASA firewall.
With an unpatched ASA firewall, the DPD would be missing unless the groupname is valid.
