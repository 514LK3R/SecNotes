# tl;dr:
  denials are logged in the avc.log (no audit daemon running) or audit.log (audit daemon running) log files
  denials might be obscured through dontaudit statements, which you can disable using semodule -DB and re-enable through semodule -B
  the denial logging gives you great detail about who (process information, including security context) is trying to do what (permission) against something (target information, including security context)

semodule -DB # Turn on all AVC Messages for which SELinux currently is "dontaudit"ing.
sealert -a /var/log/audit/audit.log > /tmp/mylogfile.txt # human readable logs, sealert -> yum install setroubleshoot-server
